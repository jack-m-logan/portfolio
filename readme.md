# Portfolio website

A portfolio website to demonstrate recent examples of work. The page - along with the projects featured within - will be updated as I progress. 

## Status 
Incomplete - to do:

* Create media queries for smaller screen sizes
* Continue writing script for interactivity/revealing text
* Review a11y and ensure site is compliant
* Tidy up the featured projects, then publish to GitHub and add links on portfolio page
* Create a separate contact page as per project requirements from Codecademy (create a contact form)
* Get the site hosted and published!
